# Suggested Improvements for the Sentiment Validation App

Here are some additional features and improvements that could be added to the data validation app:

## Short-term Improvements

1. **Dashboard View**
   - Add a summary dashboard with charts showing sentiment distribution
   - Display statistics on ground truth vs. predicted sentiment accuracy
   - Show completion status (% of entries that have been validated)

2. **Batch Operations**
   - Add functionality to select multiple rows and apply the same ground truth sentiment or comments
   - Implement batch export of selected entries to CSV for further analysis

3. **Enhanced Filtering**
   - Add date range filters
   - Add confidence score filters
   - Filter by validated/unvalidated entries

4. **UI Enhancements**
   - Add sorting capability to table columns
   - Implement pagination for better performance with large datasets
   - Add keyboard shortcuts for navigation (e.g., arrow keys for prev/next)
   - Color-code sentiment values (e.g., green for Buy, yellow for Hold, red for Sell)

5. **Search Improvements**
   - Add global search across all entries
   - Implement advanced search with regular expressions
   - Save recent searches

## Medium-term Features

1. **User Management**
   - Add login functionality for different annotators
   - Track which user made which annotations
   - Implement role-based access control

2. **Validation Workflow**
   - Add a workflow system where entries move through stages (e.g., unvalidated → validated → reviewed)
   - Allow entries to be flagged for review
   - Implement a review system where a second user can confirm validations

3. **Annotation Consistency Checks**
   - Detect inconsistencies in annotations (same text but different sentiments)
   - Highlight potential issues for review
   - Suggest annotations based on similar validated entries

4. **Advanced Analytics**
   - Generate reports on validation patterns
   - Identify common error patterns in the sentiment model
   - Track improvement over time as the model is refined

5. **Transcript Enhancement**
   - Add entity recognition highlighting in transcripts
   - Implement automatic relevant snippet extraction
   - Show context around mentions (paragraphs before/after)

## Long-term Vision

1. **Active Learning Integration**
   - Integrate with the model training pipeline to prioritize validation of the most informative examples
   - Implement online learning where model updates as validations are made

2. **Multi-modal Analysis**
   - Add audio playback for the relevant transcript sections
   - Implement sentiment timeline visualization alongside audio

3. **Prompt Engineering Interface**
   - Add a section for testing and refining prompts based on validated examples
   - Show side-by-side comparison of results with different prompts

4. **Collaborative Features**
   - Add commenting and discussion threads for specific entries
   - Implement notification system for reviews and feedback

5. **Export & Integration**
   - Add export options for various formats and downstream systems
   - Create API endpoints for integrating with other tools
   - Implement webhook notifications when validations reach certain thresholds
